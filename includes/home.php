            This website is a collection of some of my favourite fantasy books and series that I have read so far.
            This may include series that are unfinished, or I have not read all the books yet. In that case, my opinion 
            will ofcourse be based on all the books in that series that I have read so far.
            <br><br>
            I am an avid reader, and as such have read many books through the years. Fantasy books are my favourite genre, 
            so most of what I read falls in this genre, and this website will only contain books and series from the fantasy
            genre.
